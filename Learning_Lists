# This is a Codecademy Project I completed. 
You've been hired to work on a retrospective of Frida Kahlo's work at a major museum. Your job is to put together the audio tour, but in order to do that you need to create a list of each painting featured in the exhibit, the date it was painted, and its spot in the tour. 

Use your knowledge of Python lists to create a master list of each painting, its date, and its audio tour ID. 

paintings = ["The Two Fridas", "My Dress Hangs Here", "Tree of Hope", "Self Portrait With Monkeys"]
dates = [1939, 1933, 1946, 1940]
paintings = list(zip(paintings, dates))
print(paintings)

#so first I created a zipped list and then I added more paintings to my list.

addition1 = ["The Broken Column", 1944]
addition2 = ["Theo Wounded Deer", 1946]
addition3 = ["Me and My Doll", 1937]
paintings.append(addition1)
paintings.append(addition2)
paintings.append(addition3)
print(paintings)

#The next challenge was to assign an audio tour to each painting

len(list(paintings))
audio_tour_number = list(range(1, len(paintings) +1))
print(audio_tour_number)
master_list = list(zip(audio_tour_number, paintings))
print(master_list)

#Therfor I found out how many items were in my paintings-list and created a ID for each item. In the last step I zipped together the paintings list and their IDs.
